Rakaly Desktop
</h1>

**A WIP prototype desktop GUI for Rakaly functionality**

Not ready for consumption

Goals:

- **Lightweight**: Rakaly Desktop must use a minimum of resources (CPU and RAM) so as to not impact gameplay.
- **Cross platform**: Any platform that can play EU4 can use Rakaly Desktop
- **Service**: The app should be able to tie into a windows service so that it can start on boot
